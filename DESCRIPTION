Description: Contains functions carrying out adaptive procedures using mixed scaling approach to establish bioequivalence for in-vitro permeation test (IVPT) data. Currently, the package provides procedures based on parallel replicate design and balanced data, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's "Draft Guidance on Acyclovir" <https:www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/psg/Acyclovir_topical cream_RLD 21478_RV12-16.pdf>. Potvin et al. (2008) <doi:10.1002/pst.294> provides the basis for our adaptive design (see Method B). This package reflects the views of the authors and should not be construed to represent the FDA's views or policies.
